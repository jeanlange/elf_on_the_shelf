from the 2018 Codemash precompiler: [Build your second mobile app](http://www.codemash.org/sessions/?id=6971)

This IOS mobile app (written in Swift and demoing AR Kit) has two screens that show weather for two different cities by calling a weather API and reading the JSON that comes back. This was the basic 'building a mobile app' part of the workshop, with a focus on understanding protocols in Swift. We tested this part through the simulator.

The second part of the app used AR Kit to:
* detect and show horizontal planes using the camera
* let the user touch a plane to place a Santa hat (in an augemented reality plane)

My version of this second part is untested, as I didn't have an IOS device to try it out on. So I just copied and pasted hopefully in the right places.
